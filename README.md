# Using Python to Access Web Data
The repo contains code for excercises completed by me during University of Michigan ["Using Python to Access Web Data"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python) class.

Course description on Coursera:

*This course will show how one can treat the Internet as a source of data.  We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs.  We will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.  This course will cover Chapters 11-13 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. To succeed in this course, you should be familiar with the material covered in Chapters 1-10 of the textbook and the first two courses in this specialization.  These topics include variables and expressions, conditional execution (loops, branching, and try/except), functions, Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples), and manipulating files.  This course covers Python 3.*

## List of files and folders:

1. **finding_numbers**: a script (1_finding_numbers.py) and data to run the script on (1_finding_numbers.txt, [source](http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/)). The script performs following tasks:
 - reads through and parses a file with text and numbers, 
 - extracts all the numbers in the file, 
 - computes their sum.
